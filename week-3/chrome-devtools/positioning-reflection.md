####How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
You can use DevTools to test things out and see how it would look like instantly without affecting the actual site. It's also a good way to learn and to have better understanding of CSS positioning using DevTools. You can use it to look at others' site and see what kind of elements were used and how they were used to create the site. 

####How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can resize elements but changing it's width and the height.

####What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Absolute - It basically forces the elements to stay in a specific location on the site by changing it's top, bottom, left, and right. (Does not move along when scrolling up or down.)
Fixed - Works like abosolute but it move along when scrolling. 
Static - It's the default of position and it position itself depending on how HTML is written or how the site flows.
Relative - It's kind of like static except that it can shift the elements with top, bottom, left, and right. Relative, like static, follows the site flow.

I fount relative the easiet and absolute the most difficult. Relative is very basic, it follows the site flow which means I don't have to worry too much it will flies around on the site when I change it's top, bottom, left, or right. On the other hand, since absolute does not follows the site I have to be very precise with the numbers in order to get it to position exactly where I wanted. Also, it can get weird when it makes another element behind or in front of another element. Aboslute jsut need a lot of practice to master it. 

####What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
These three are like a box that contains content within them. 
Margin - An invisible "box" and it defines the space around a content/element.
Border - A visible "box" and it allows you to create a border around the content/element.
Padding - An invisible "box" that defines the space between the content/elements and the border.

####What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
Totatlly a love and hate impression lol. Love that it gave me a better undertanding of CSS positioning. Hate how frustraing that it could get trying to figure it out how to position the elements. This challenge was fun and cool because I didn't know that DevTools can be used like that.
