# Numbers to Commas Solo Challenge

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.

# 0. Pseudocode
# What is the input? 
    # Input will be a positive integer as an argument
    
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
    # Output will be a positive integer with comma(s) separating it
    
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
    # Create a method named separate_comma with an argument(num)
        # Turn argument(num) into string
        # Counts the characters of the argument(num)
        # Split the argument(number) with comma
            # No comma IF length is less than 4
            # Put comma IF length is more than 3
                # Place comma after a count of 3 characters 
    # End method


# 1. Initial Solution
def separate_comma(num)
    s = num.to_s
    l = s.length
    if l < 4
        p num
    elsif l > 3
        
    end    
end  
separate_comma(90)
