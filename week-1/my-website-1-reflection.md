Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository on GitHub, click on the "+" symbol located on the upper left corner next to your profile. It will display two options and one of them is "New repository". Once clicked "New repository", a new page will show with options for you to create your new repository. Once everything is set, simply click "Create repository" and you're done!
To clone the repository to you local computer, go to the repository you wish to clone. Once you're there, you will see a HTTPS or SSH URL. Copy the URL and typed in "git clone URL-THAT-WAS-COPIED". Your repository is now cloned to your computer.

Describe what open source means.
Open source means the source is allow for other to use and customize.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Personally, I think open source is great because it allows us to use and share software. I think we can learn a lot from each other through open source since everyone do things differently, we can adapt new techniques from each other.
No, it doesn't makes me nervous since people have a choice whether they want to put it as open source or not. When they do put it as open source, they already know someone will eventually use it for their own purpose or even modifies it. I don't really see the harm for both creator and user. 
And, yes, it does kind of feel lie utopia since there are many open source out there for us to explore and learn from it.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses grant very specific permissions for other who wish to use the open source. 

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This challenege solidified concepts like creating website, open source, and liceses. I did had a "aha" moment when I realise this challenge is preparing us for next week (at least that's what I thought). Surprisingly, I did not struggled with it. In fact, it was once of the smoothest challenge I did. 

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
