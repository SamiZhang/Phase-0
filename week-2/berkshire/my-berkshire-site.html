<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
Amazing! I had a lot of fun making this site with HTML. 

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It wasn't hard to research about HTML5 and most of the instructions were very simple to understand. It makes it very easy for me to use the elements.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Like the example given, no formatting for me. I forced myself to type out everything besides for the links and the texts. I think it's the best way for me to learn, remember, and understand how things work for HTML.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML is very simple and straight forward. It's definitely not hard to learn it and using it. What's bad about HTML is that it's very limited to what I can do to the site as for styling but that's what CSS is for. So, I guess there's really nothing bad about it for now? Since I haven't learn everything about it yet.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
PRACTICE! I mean, for anything, the more we practice the better we'll be at it. Whenever I have time I will search for some HTML tricks and tips and just try it myself to see how it works. Also, typing the commands out even though I might have to repeat some multiple times. It's a good way for me to memorize them.
