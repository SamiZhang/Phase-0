What is an integer? What is a float?
Integer is numbers without a decimal point, and as for float, it is numbers with a decimal point.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
The difference between float and integer division is float divisions will provide you a decimal answer while integer division can only provde a rounded down integer answer. For example, if you divide any odd number, like 7, by 2 using interger division, the answer you get will be 3 instead of 3.5.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
String is something that contain a group of letters or numbers. It also can carries punctuation, symbols, and spaces. You use string when assigning a variable or even use it when you want Ruby to "puts" a sentece out or to do math. I felt like string can be use anytime as long as we are using it correctly. 

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variable is the first assignment. It's good to use it when you have to repeat something, like a string, over and over again because once you create a local variable you can just call it out without typing the whole string. 

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This challenge was a very good practice for me to understand the basics of Ruby. It really allowed me to get an experience of how Ruby functions.
